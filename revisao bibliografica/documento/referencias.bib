ABSTRACT = {Inspections of concrete bridges across the United States represent a significant commitment of resources, given their biannual mandate for many structures. With a notable number of aging bridges, there is an imperative need to enhance the efficiency of these inspections. This study harnessed the power of computer vision to streamline the inspection process. Our experiment examined the efficacy of a state-of-the-art Visual Transformer (ViT) model combined with distinct image enhancement detector algorithms. We benchmarked against a deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. These models were applied to over 20,000 high-quality images from the Concrete Images for Classification dataset. Traditional crack detection methods often fall short due to their heavy reliance on time and resources. This research pioneers bridge inspection by integrating ViT with diverse image enhancement detectors, significantly improving concrete crack detection accuracy. Notably, a custom-built CNN achieves over 99% accuracy with substantially lower training time than ViT, making it an efficient solution for enhancing safety and resource conservation in infrastructure management. These advancements enhance safety by enabling reliable detection and timely maintenance, but they also align with Industry 4.0 objectives, automating manual inspections, reducing costs, and advancing technological integration in public infrastructure management.},

Applying Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) and imaging techniques is essential for identifying irregularities without causing harm. This research utilizes pre-trained models and incorporates transfer learning concepts to overcome dataset constraints. This study assesses the effectiveness of various machine learning models, including the Vision Transformer (ViT), Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), VGG19, VGG16, and ResNet50, in enhancing NDE for railway track fasteners. ViT and DeiT, both transformer-based models, emerged as the top performers due to their superior learning efficiencies and generalization capabilities, augmented by precise hyperparameter tuning. VGG models are a reliable alternative, while ResNet50 is better suited for applications prioritizing computational efficiency over accuracy.}

abstract = {As a result of long-term pressure from train operations and direct exposure to the natural environment, rails, fasteners, and other components of railway track lines inevitably produce defects, which have a direct impact on the safety of train operations. In this study, a multiobject detection method based on deep convolutional neural network that can achieve nondestructive detection of rail surface and fastener defects is proposed. First, rails and fasteners on the railway track image are localized by the improved YOLOv5 framework. Then, the defect detection model based on Mask R-CNN is utilized to detect the surface defects of the rail and segment the defect area. Finally, the model based on ResNet framework is used to classify the state of the fasteners. To verify the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct experimental tests using the ballast and ballastless railway track images collected from Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan high-speed railway line. Through a variety of evaluation indexes to compare with other methods using deep learning algorithms, experimental results show that our method outperforms others in all stages and enables effective detection of rail surface and fasteners.},

abstract = {Accurate train delay prediction is vital for effective railway traffic planning and management as well as for providing satisfactory passenger service quality. Despite significant advances in data-driven train delay predictions, it lacks of a systematic review of studies and unified modelling development framework. The paper reviews existing studies with an explicit focus on synthesizing a structural framework that could guide effective data-driven train delay prediction model development. The framework consists of three stages including design concept, modelling and evaluation. The study synthesize and discusses six important modules of the framework: (1) Problem scope, (2) Model inputs, (3) Data quality, (4) Methodologies, (5) Model outputs, and (6) Evaluation techniques. For each module, the important problems and techniques reported are synthesized and research gaps are discussed. The review found that most studies focus on developing complex methodologies for the next stop delay predictions that have limited applications in practice. All studies validate the model accuracy, but very few consider other model performance aspects which makes it difficult to assess their usfulness in practical deployment. Future studies need a holistic view on defining the train delay prediction problem considering both application requirements and implementation challenges. Also, the modelling studies should place more attention to data quality and comprehensive model evaluations in representation power, explainability and validity.}

abstract = {The use of public transport data has evolved rapidly over the past decades. Indeed, the availability of diverse data sources and advances in analytics have led to a greater emphasis on utilizing data to enhance public transport services. Rail transit systems have increasingly become the preferred mode of travel due to their comfort, speed, and (mostly) emission-free nature. However, persistent delays continue to be a concern. Machine learning-based prediction of transit delays is an emerging field gaining recognition. The first contribution of this paper is to illustrate how to exploit available open data to improve the prediction of rail transit delays using machine learning. Moreover, through a comparison of various well-known machine learning approaches, we show that they can yield significantly different results. Notably, the improved support vector machine method presented in this study exhibits exceptional performance and is well-suited for long-term predictions. Furthermore, we have incorporated explainable artificial intelligence techniques to identify and assess the most significant factors influencing delays. To perform experiments with the method and draw robust conclusions, three case studies featuring different rail services in major cities are provided.}
