abstract = {Safety data and information are the most valuable assets for organizations’ safety decision-making (SDM), especially in the era of big data (BD). In this study, a conceptual framework for SDM based on BD, known as BD-driven SDM, was developed and its detailed structure and elements as well as strategies were presented. Other theoretical and practical contributions include: (a) the description of the meta-process and interdisciplinary research area of BD-driven SDM, (b) the design of six types of general analytics and five types of special analytics for SBD mining according to different requirements of safety management applications, (c) the analysis of influencing factors of BD-driven SDM, and (d) the discussion of advantages and limitations in this research as well as suggestions for future research. The results obtained from this study are of important implications for research and practice on BD-driven SDM.}

ABSTRACT = {Inspections of concrete bridges across the United States represent a significant commitment of resources, given their biannual mandate for many structures. With a notable number of aging bridges, there is an imperative need to enhance the efficiency of these inspections. This study harnessed the power of computer vision to streamline the inspection process. Our experiment examined the efficacy of a state-of-the-art Visual Transformer (ViT) model combined with distinct image enhancement detector algorithms. We benchmarked against a deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. These models were applied to over 20,000 high-quality images from the Concrete Images for Classification dataset. Traditional crack detection methods often fall short due to their heavy reliance on time and resources. This research pioneers bridge inspection by integrating ViT with diverse image enhancement detectors, significantly improving concrete crack detection accuracy. Notably, a custom-built CNN achieves over 99% accuracy with substantially lower training time than ViT, making it an efficient solution for enhancing safety and resource conservation in infrastructure management. These advancements enhance safety by enabling reliable detection and timely maintenance, but they also align with Industry 4.0 objectives, automating manual inspections, reducing costs, and advancing technological integration in public infrastructure management.},

abstract = {Predictive health management and maintenance of transport infrastructure are critical for preventing accidents and service disruptions. Applying Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) and imaging techniques is essential for identifying irregularities without causing harm. This research utilizes pre-trained models and incorporates transfer learning concepts to overcome dataset constraints. This study assesses the effectiveness of various machine learning models, including the Vision Transformer (ViT), Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), VGG19, VGG16, and ResNet50, in enhancing NDE for railway track fasteners. ViT and DeiT, both transformer-based models, emerged as the top performers due to their superior learning efficiencies and generalization capabilities, augmented by precise hyperparameter tuning. VGG models are a reliable alternative, while ResNet50 is better suited for applications prioritizing computational efficiency over accuracy.}
